    title: "Anthropic cuts off OpenAI's access to its Claude models",
    content: `
      <p class="lead">Anthropic has revoked OpenAI’s access to its Claude family of AI models, according to a report in Wired.</p>
      <p class="lead">Sources told Wired that OpenAI was connecting Claude to internal tools that allowed the company to compare Claude’s performance to its own models in categories like coding, writing, and safety.</p>
      <p class="lead">In a statement provided to TechCrunch, an Anthropic spokesperson said, “OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5,” which is apparently “a direct violation of our terms of service.” (Anthropic’s commercial terms forbid companies from using Claude to build competing services.)</P>  
      <p class="lead">However, the company also said it would continue to give OpenAI access “for the purposes of benchmarking and safety evaluations.”</P>  
      <p class="lead">Meanwhile, in a statement of its own, an OpenAI spokesperson described its usage as “industry standard” and added, “While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.”</P>  
      <p class="lead">Anthropic executives had already shown resistance to providing access to competitors, with Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan previously justifying the company’s decision to cut off Windsurf (a rumored OpenAI acquisition target, subsequently acquired by Cognition) by saying, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.”</P>

      <p class="lead">Technology has repeatedly revolutionized the way the world works, from Alexander Graham Bell’s invention of the telephone in 1876, to the launch of Apple’s first iPhone in 2007, to the AI boom of the last decade. Now, as AI enters the mainstream, companies are racing to adopt it in both their own offerings and internal tools to boost their teams’ efficiency and productivity. Those who opt out risk being left behind in the next great transformation.</p>
      <p class="lead">For designers, this wave of AI adoption means more resources and investment given to them to create exceptional AI experiences. For enterprise products, AI design is more than just building an intelligent assistant. Successful AI design requires thinking about two very different audiences: end users and governance stakeholders. These two audiences can often oppose each other, where one pushes for control and security, while the other wants speed and clarity.</p>
      <p class="lead">In this article, we’ll explore the risks involved with ignoring one side and how to design experiences that balance usability with governance so both users and stakeholders can trust and adopt your AI product.</p>
      <h3>The two audiences every designer must consider</h3>
      <p class="lead">When designing AI products, we often tend to focus only on the end user. This is the person interacting with the product, typing prompts, asking questions, or reviewing AI-generated insights. But there is another audience that designers need to consider equally: governance stakeholders.</p>
      <p class="lead">These are the people in an organization responsible for risk, security, legal compliance, data policies, and operational oversight. They might not use the AI product day-to-day, but they influence or control whether it gets approved, scaled, or shut down entirely.</p>
      <p class="lead">End users care about whether the product helps them do their job better or faster. They may define success by asking questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Does this tool fit into my daily workflow?”</li>
        <li>“Is it easy to understand how to interact with the product?”</li>
        <li>“Does the tool provide useful and accurate results quickly?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead">Their priorities include usability, clarity, and speed.</p>
      <p class="lead">Governance stakeholders, on the other hand, aren’t the ones interacting with the product’s UI. They care about whether the tool is safe, compliant, and transparent. They may ask questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Is the data being handled securely?”</li>
        <li>“Can we audit who’s doing what in the tool?”</li>
        <li>“Does this align with company policies and industry regulations?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead">They’re responsible for ensuring the product handles data safely, remains compliant, and doesn’t introduce</p>
      <p class="lead">risks that could lead to security, legal, or reputational issues.</p>
      <p class="lead">These two audiences have very different goals and definitions of success, but both need to be addressed</p>
      <p class="lead">when making design decisions.</p>
      <h3>The risk of designing for just one side</h3>
      <p class="lead">When designers ignore the end users or governance stakeholders in the design process, this can lead to serious risks. It’s not enough for an AI product to be delightful but untrustworthy, or secure but unintuitive. If one side is neglected, the entire product can fail.</p>
      <p class="lead">At a previous company, our team had built an internal AI assistant designed to help quickly synthesize research insights. The tool was useful for our team, as we could ask it questions like “What are the top risks in our industry this quarter?” and it would generate summaries sourced directly from our own reports and research notes.</p>
      <p class="lead">But while the interface was intuitive and the performance was quick, we hadn’t brought in legal or IT to review the tool from a compliance standpoint. The AI was surfacing content from a mix of internal and external sources, which included confidential materials. We didn’t have clear policies around data permissions or visibility into what content was being used in responses. One day, someone noticed the tool surfaced details from a restricted internal strategy document. That triggered immediate concerns around data exposure.</p>
      <p class="lead">As a result, legal halted the rollout of the tool and IT began to audit. In the end, our organization didn’t adopt the tool due to poor oversight, which led to trust fading. This is a clear lesson that great UX without governance is not enough when it comes to designing enterprise AI products. We should have involved governance stakeholders early on in the design process to understand their concerns, their goals, and the risks of getting it wrong.</p>
      <h3>Turning governance into a UX opportunity</h3>
      <p class="lead">Designers may view governance as a restriction or limitation to their creative freedom. It can be seen as a blocker that slows things down or adds friction to otherwise delightful experiences. But in reality, governance is just another user need and can be seen as an opportunity for designers to flex their creative skills. Just like we design for usability, we can design for security, transparency, and responsible AI usage. The goal is to make safe behavior intuitive, obvious, and effortless. Here are a few ways to turn governance requirements into opportunities to create a good user experience.</p>
      <h3>Permissions</h3>
      <p class="lead">When it comes to access control, many enterprise tools keep permissions in admin panels or expect users to interpret complex role settings. But this can be reimagined with better UX. One example is to have smart defaults that automatically assign appropriate permissions based on a user’s role or department. This can reduce the need for manual setup.</p>
      <p class="lead">Another way to improve the permissions experience is to make roles and access levels visible to users. Give users immediate context around what they can and cannot access, and why. Instead of using vague labels like “Editor” or “Viewer”, AI tools can be more descriptive in terms of describing what the user can do. For example, a label that says “You can view a recording’s audit trail” describes specifically what the user can do.</p>
      <h3>Transparency</h3>
      <p class="lead">AI systems come with uncertainties, which can make both users and stakeholders hesitant to adopt a new AI product. AI transparency helps build trust by explaining things like what data the system is trained on, where it sourced its answers, or why the model made a certain recommendation.</p>
      <p class="lead">Designers can surface this context in several different ways. You can include inline explanations, such as “This summary was generated from 3 sources: A, B, and C” with hyperlinks to each source. This can help build user confidence in the responses as they can easily verify the information from the source.</p>
      <p class="lead">Another solution could be using model confidence indicators, such as low, medium, or high certainty scores or callouts. Sometimes AI models can “hallucinate” or generate inaccurate or fabricated responses, which may seem plausible or realistic. By including a confidence score along with the AI-generated content, users are reminded that AI models are not always right and to do their own fact-checking before relying on the AI output.</p>
      <p class="lead">Finally, if the AI tool triggers sensitive actions, such as sharing client data, it can be helpful to add some friction in the form of tooltips or modals that inform the user of the potential consequences. It’s always better to prompt the user about the potential risks of performing an action and empower them to make informed decisions. Depending on the use case, blocking users from making their own decisions can lead to confusion, frustration, and decreased satisfaction with the product.</p>
      <h3>Integrating governance into your design process</h3>
      <p class="lead">Too often, governance concerns surface late in the development process. Having to do rework right before a launch because of a missed requirement can become an expensive mistake. A better approach is to bring governance stakeholders into the process from day one, just like you would with engineers or product managers. This way, their needs are integrated into your designs from the start, which leads to fewer surprises down the road.</p>
      <p class="lead">A helpful alignment activity that you can run at the start of the project is a stakeholder mapping workshop. This allows the team to identify who is involved in the project, directly or indirectly, and clarify their roles, priorities, and concerns. Some examples of stakeholders can include end users, legal, IT, or government organizations. Based on each stakeholder’s level of influence, you can determine how and when to engage with them throughout the project.</p>
      <p class="lead">Once you’ve identified your key players, the next step is to map out the user journey. Rather than focusing solely on the end user, overlay their journey with the governance stakeholders’ journey. Throughout the journey, probe stakeholders with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What policies or approvals apply to this AI use case?</li>
        <li>What data can or can’t be used in prompts?</li>
        <li>Who needs visibility or audit trails?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead">This will help reveal where needs intersect and the friction points to pay close attention to. Look for flows where the risks of error or misunderstanding are higher, such as data handling or AI recommendations. For example, users may expect instant answers based on data, but governance stakeholders require data to be masked or restricted depending on the sensitivity level. Users may expect personalized recommendations, but governance stakeholders need explanations for how those outputs were generated and whether they meet compliance standards.</p>
      <p class="lead">After the journey is mapped out, collaborate with your team to define and prioritize requirements from both the user and governance sides. This creates a shared understanding of what needs to be completed for the product to launch successfully. By asking these questions early and designing with both sides in mind, you reduce risk, avoid last-minute blockers, and build a product that’s not only intuitive to use but also trustworthy, scalable, and compliant.</p>
      <p class="lead">Then, start to layer those requirements into your designs. This can look like using confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions, tooltips that explain the model’s confidence level, or visible audit trails that track who did what and when. Adding these thoughtful elements to your design can make your users feel informed and in control when using the AI tool.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="lead">Designing great AI products means designing for two audiences: end users and governance stakeholders. End users care about speed, clarity, and integration into their existing workflow, while governance stakeholders focus on data security, auditability, and policy compliance. When either audience is ignored, this can lead to failed rollouts, low adoption, or serious risk exposure.</p>
      <p class="lead">If you’re working on an AI product, be intentional about identifying and engaging with relevant stakeholders throughout your design process. Involve governance stakeholders early on so that their needs and requirements aren’t missed, and let you find creative ways to address them within the user experience.</p>
      <p class="lead">Governance is essential, not a barrier, to a good user experience. It doesn’t have to restrict your creative process. Mapping out the user journey can help you visualize where governance and user needs intersect. When done thoughtfully, it enables you to design experiences that build trust and confidence in your users, making them feel informed and in control when using your AI tool. For AI products to succeed, digital safety is not optional.</p>

    title: "Next.js 15.4 is here: What’s new and what to expect",
    content: `
      <p class="lead">Turbopack has been talked about for a while as the future of frontend bundling, but up until now, it hasn’t quite felt “ready” for serious production use. That changes with 15.4. This new release introduces significant improvements and sets the stage for what’s next, with the arrival of Next.js 16 later this summer.</p>
      <p class="lead">So, if you’ve been holding off on upgrading, waiting to see if Turbopack is finally stable enough, or simply curious about what’s new under the hood, you are in the right place. In this article, we’ll break down what’s new in 15.4, explore some hidden gems, and take a quick look at what’s ahead in the Next.js roadmap.</p>
      <h3>Next.js 15.4: Key highlights</h3>
      <h3>Turbopack builds hit 100% test coverage</h3>
      <p class="lead">One of the standout highlights in the Next.js 15.4 release is that the <PlainCode>next build --turbopack</PlainCode> successfully passes all 8,302 integration tests for production builds. That’s thousands of edge cases, regressions, and real-world scenarios that are now confidently handled by Turbopack.</p>
      <p class="lead">It’s a major milestone in the framework’s evolution, bringing this new bundler one step closer to becoming the default. The significance of this milestone becomes even clearer when you consider that Vercel is now using Turbopack to power its high-traffic site. This is a strong signal that Turbopack is no longer experimental; it’s reliable.</p>
      <h3>What does this mean for developers now?</h3>
      <p class="lead">While 15.4 doesn’t introduce flashy new features for Turbopack, it does bring significant improvements under the hood. A wide range of performance tweaks and stability fixes have made the build process smoother and more reliable. If you tried Turbopack a few months ago and ran into trouble, now’s a great time to give it another shot.</p>
      <p class="lead">The team’s main focus moving forward is on two priorities: completing bundling optimizations through production chunking and fixing bugs reported by early adopters of the Alpha release. The goal is to officially transition Turbopack into beta with the release of Next.js 16, a milestone that’s now within reach thanks to the groundwork laid in 15.4.</p>
      <p class="lead">In short, Turbopack has improved considerably. It’s now fast, stable, and on track to become a viable replacement for Webpack in production environments.</p>
      <h3>Notable changes: Features, fixes, and improvements</h3>
      <p class="lead">Next.js 15.4 isn’t just about Turbopack; it’s packed with practical improvements that solve real problems developers face every day. Let’s break down the changes that are likely to impact your workflow:</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p class="lead">Several practical features have been introduced to enhance both the development workflow and production behavior:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prefetch invalidation Hook — Introduces an <PlainCode>onInvalidate</PlainCode> callback for <PlainCode>router.prefetch()</PlainCode> . When cached data becomes stale, this Hook triggers automatic re-fetching, useful for custom navigation components requiring real-time synchronization without relying on Next.js’s built-in <PlainCode><code>Link</code></PlainCode></li>
        <li>Link <PlainCode>prefetch</PlainCode> semantic alias — Introduces <PlainCode>prefetch="auto"</PlainCode> as syntactic sugar for <PlainCode>prefetch={undefined}</PlainCode>, improving code readability while maintaining the default adaptive prefetch behavior</li>
        <li>Metadata support for <PlainCode>global-not-found</PlainCode> pages — Enables full metadata export capabilities in <PlainCode>global-not-found.js</PlainCode>, allowing customized SEO tags and structured data for 404 pages</li>
        <li>New CLI flag <PlainCode>--debug-prerender</PlainCode> — Introduces the <PlainCode>--debug-prerender</PlainCode> flag to <PlainCode>next build</PlainCode>, providing detailed diagnostics and full error stacks to help troubleshoot issues with partial pre-rendering (PPR) and static generation, strictly for development use, not production</li>
        <li><PlainCode>htmlrewriter</PlainCode> in server externals — Enables use of the <PlainCode>htmlrewriter</PlainCode> package within server runtimes for HTML transformations</li>
        <li>Partial pre-rendering support for intercepted routes — Expands the capabilities of partial pre-rendering by supporting dynamic routes with intercepting behavior</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fixes</h3>
      <p class="lead">This release also resolves several important bugs and issues.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Config module cloning to avoid mutation — Prevents unintended side effects by ensuring configuration objects are safely duplicated</li>
        <li>Prefetch cache consistency — Ensures <PlainCode>staleTime</PlainCode> propagates to seeded prefetch entries and fixed stale prefetch retention for static pages</li>
        <li>Fix for <PlainCode>Vary</PlainCode> header reinstatement — Restores proper handling of the <PlainCode>Vary</PlainCode> response header for better caching behavior</li>
        <li>React Compiler adjustments — Fixes inconsistencies in the compiler’s detection of “interestingness” and “usefulness,” thereby improving compilation accuracy</li>
        <li>Fix for edge-case file paths in <PlainCode>launchEditor</PlainCode> — Improves developer experience by gracefully handling unexpected file path formats when using the editor launch utility</li>
        <li>Server action fixes — Fixed <PlainCode>bodySizeLimit</PlainCode> errors with non-multipart actions and ensured proper 404 responses for invalid action IDs, thereby improving server action reliability</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p class="lead">This release also includes improvements to existing features.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preserve RSC queries on redirect — Ensures that server component queries are preserved when performing redirects, avoiding broken navigation flows</li>
        <li>Graceful fallbacks for bots — Introduces a specialized error fallback for crawler bot requests to preserve SEO integrity during render failures</li>
        <li>Disallow <PlainCode>unstable_rootParams</PlainCode> in client components — Enforces boundaries between server and client components by disallowing the use of unstable root parameters in client contexts</li>
        <li>RSC request validation — Added cache-busting parameter verification to RSC (React Server Components) requests, preventing redundant processing of invalidated queries</li>
        <li>Dependency management — Marked <PlainCode>assert/strict</PlainCode> as an external dependency and upgraded <PlainCode>@vercel/og</PlainCode> to 0.7.2 for improved image generation</li>
        <li>Streaming metadata — Ensures streaming metadata is always rendered at the top-level position, preserving a valid document structure</li>
        <li>Automatic omission of <PlainCode>searchParam</PlainCode> data in <PlainCode>FlightRouterState</PlainCode> before transport — Reduces payload size and avoids unnecessary rerenders in streamed routing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hidden gems in Next.js 15.4</h3>
      <p class="lead">While the major features capture most of the attention, Next.js 15.4 includes some smaller improvements that may go unnoticed but offer significant value to developers working on specific use cases:</p>
      <h3>Dev server UX</h3>
      <p class="lead">This adds the ability to restart the dev server directly from the error overlay and indicator preferences, improving iteration speed during debugging. While seemingly small, this enhancement can drastically speed up debugging cycles, especially during local development with hot module replacement issues.</p>
      <h3>Performance enhancements</h3>
      <p class="lead">The team has made significant efforts in improving static path generation performance and parameter handling. They have also optimized the React Compiler integration by checking files with SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) first, which should result in faster compilation times across the board.</p>
      <p class="lead">Additionally, the improved CPU profiling support during development (NEXT_CPU_PROF usage fixes) might not seem exciting, but for teams dealing with performance bottlenecks, being able to capture accurate CPU traces during development is invaluable. This is the kind of tooling that separates professional-grade frameworks from hobby projects.</p>
      <h3>When and why you should update to 15.4</h3>
      <p class="lead">The decision to upgrade to Next.js 15.4 largely depends on your current setup and specific needs. If you are currently using an older version of Next.js and have not been closely following the Turbopack development, 15.4 represents an excellent opportunity to experience the performance improvements firsthand. The combination of faster build times and improved development server performance can significantly impact your daily development workflow, especially for larger applications.</p>
      <p class="lead">However, as with any framework upgrade, it’s wise to test thoroughly in a development environment first. While Next.js maintains excellent backward compatibility, the extensive changes in 15.4 warrant careful testing, particularly if you are using advanced features or have a complex application architecture.</p>
      <p class="lead">For new projects, starting with 15.4 gives you access to the latest improvements and sets you up for a smooth transition to Next.js 16 when it arrives.</p>
      <h3>How to upgrade</h3>
      <p class="lead">Upgrading to Next.js 15.4 is straightforward, with the team providing multiple paths depending on your preferences and project setup.</p>
      <p class="lead">The recommended approach is to use the automated upgrade CLI, which handles dependency updates and can identify potential compatibility issues:</p>
      <PlainCode>npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest</PlainCode>
      <p class="lead">This tool not only updates your dependencies but also runs codemods that can automatically fix common compatibility issues, saving you time and reducing the risk of manual errors.</p>
      <p class="lead">If you prefer manual control over the upgrade process, you can update the dependencies directly:</p>
      <PlainCode>npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest</PlainCode>
      <p class="lead">For new projects, you can start with Next.js 15.4 from the beginning:</p>
      <PlainCode>npx create-next-app@latest</PlainCode>
      <p class="lead">Before upgrading production apps, test the update in a development or staging environment. Focus on build times, runtime performance, and any custom configurations that the changes may impact.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="lead">Next.js 15.4 is more than just a minor update; it’s a sign of maturity for the Next.js ecosystem. Achieving 100% integration test compatibility for Turbopack builds, along with numerous improvements and bug fixes, shows that Next.js continues to grow in response to real developer needs.</p>
      <p class="lead">Whether you’re upgrading an existing app or starting a new project, 15.4 provides immediate benefits and prepares you for what’s coming in Next.js 16. As always, test thoroughly before deploying to production, but if you’ve been waiting for a reason to upgrade, this release might be it.</p>

    title: "Catch frontend issues before users using chaos engineering",
    content: `
    <p class="lead">Chaos engineering involves introducing controlled failures into a system to identify weak points before they impact users. While traditionally applied to backend services, applying chaos principles to the frontend helps uncover UI and UX issues that don’t surface through conventional testing.</p>
    <p class="lead">Frontend chaos engineering focuses on proactively simulating real-world failure scenarios, such as slow APIs, unpredictable UI interactions, directly in the browser. The objective is to surface edge-case bugs, rendering inconsistencies, and performance regressions before they reach production. This shifts the mindset from purely reactive bug fixing to systematic failure injection during development and staging.</p>
    <h3>Understanding frontend chaos engineering</h3>
    <p class="lead">The goals of frontend chaos differ significantly from backend chaos. In backend systems, the emphasis is typically on system uptime, failover, and throughput under stress. Frontend systems, on the other hand, are concerned with UI responsiveness, client-side rendering behavior, race conditions in component lifecycle events, and dependency failures in the browser environment. Frontend chaos engineering deals directly with how the application looks and behaves under degraded circumstances, which is often more user-visible than backend outages.</p>
    <p class="lead">Typical frontend failure scenarios include delayed or partial responses from APIs, unresponsive UI components due to unhandled async logic, and third-party analytics or CDN scripts failing to load. These are not server crashes; they’re subtle behaviors like an invisible button, a frozen spinner, or a layout collapse triggered by malformed data.</p>
    <p class="lead">Tools for implementing frontend chaos include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>gremlins.js for UI disruption</li>
      <li>Latency injection through <PlainCode>devtools</PlainCode> throttling or service worker mocks</li>
      <li>Component mocking to simulate missing or malformed data</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead">You can also use browser automation tools like Playwright or Cypress with chaos scripts to reproduce state-specific bugs under failure modes. These tools don’t just test features; they push the boundaries of what your UI can tolerate under pressure.</p>
    <h3>Why traditional testing isn’t enough</h3>
    <p class="lead">Frontend projects typically rely on a layered test suite: unit tests validate logic in isolation, integration tests ensure modules work together, and end-to-end tests verify the full UI flow. However, these tests assume a stable environment. They validate correctness, not resilience. They rarely simulate dropped packets, delayed API responses, or the inconsistent behavior of browser APIs under memory pressure. Most frontend test runners operate in headless environments and fail to account for real-world instability.</p>
    <p class="lead">Real-world failures often stem from environmental unpredictability, slow third-party dependencies, or unpredictable user behavior. For example, an E2E test might confirm that the user profile renders correctly on login, but it won’t catch a real-world issue where a race condition causes the <PlainCode>useEffect</PlainCode> Hook to set stale state due to a throttled API call.</p>
    <p class="lead">Testing in unpredictable environments is necessary to identify these failure paths. Running UI under degraded conditions, such as injecting random network jitter or simulating CPU throttling, reveals bugs that static tests can’t catch. Chaos testing introduces entropy into the system, forcing your UI code to react (or break) under pressure, which is where the real stability issues are exposed.</p>
    <h3>Best practices and safety tips</h3>
    <p class="lead">Chaos experiments on the frontend must be conducted with precision to avoid disrupting real users or producing misleading signals. This section outlines practices for running experiments safely, coordinating across teams, and limiting the impact of injected failures. As a reminder, always execute chaos experiments in controlled environments!</p>

      <li>Begin locally during development using browser-based injection tools or mocking libraries. Extend the test to staging environments where telemetry is active and user data is fake. Avoid running chaos in production unless the experiments are fully isolated and reversible. The focus should be on predictable, observable failures in an environment where their impact can be traced and understood</li>
      <li>Involve both QA and frontend engineers in the design and review of each experiment. QA teams bring experience in edge-case behavior and regression patterns, while frontend developers understand the stateful nature of the UI and its coupling to backend APIs. Try to define failure conditions, expected outcomes, and safe rollback paths to help surface risks early. This collaboration also ensures that findings from chaos tests lead to actionable fixes rather than being dismissed as anomalies</li>
      <li>Use feature flags to gate chaos logic and allow fine-grained targeting. Flags can restrict experiments to specific routes, components, or sessions. Combine this with user scoping, such as running tests only for internal accounts or based on geolocation, to limit impact. In React and similar frameworks, error boundaries provide an additional safety layer. Wrap risky components in <PlainCode>ErrorBoundary</PlainCode> elements to catch rendering crashes and fall back to neutral UI states without collapsing the entire view</li>
      <li>Avoid abrupt rollouts. Introduce chaos logic incrementally, starting with a small percentage of test users or running experiments during low-traffic periods. Monitor metrics like console error rates, interaction latency, and visual regressions in real-time</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead">These practices ensure that chaos experiments are repeatable and reversible. They prevent disruption to development speed or user satisfaction while giving you a structured path toward building more resilient frontends.</p>
    <h3>Benefits of frontend chaos engineering</h3>
    <p class="lead">When I first started applying chaos engineering to a React frontend project, the goal was simple: uncover why some users occasionally saw blank components after login. Traditional tests weren’t catching it, E2E passed, unit tests were fine, but once in production, we’d get a few scattered reports with no clear reproduction path.</p>
    <p class="lead">We began by simulating API latency and injecting partial responses using a custom service worker during local development. This exposed a rendering issue: the UserDashboard component assumed the user profile object would always exist. In cases where the API responded slowly or with a missing field, the component rendered nothing and didn’t throw any error. This wasn’t visible in test environments because everything was too fast and too clean.</p>
    <p class="lead">To avoid impacting real users, we ran the chaos logic behind a <PlainCode>localStorage</PlainCode> flag and later hooked it into a feature flag system (we used LaunchDarkly). This let us toggle chaos on only for test accounts in staging. We also wrapped key components in React error boundaries to ensure any crashes would be caught and displayed with a fallback UI instead of a full white screen.</p>
    <p class="lead">The turning point came when we expanded the experiment to staging with network throttling. We randomly delayed the <PlainCode>/profile</PlainCode> and <PlainCode>/settings</PlainCode> endpoints and observed how different UI states behaved. What we learned was invaluable: some components relied on derived state from incomplete data, others didn’t handle null values well, and a few caused layout shifts that degraded UX under load.</p>
    <p class="lead">We involved QA engineers in designing these experiments. They contributed scenarios we hadn’t considered, like interrupting requests mid-flight or triggering rapid navigation between tabs. Their feedback helped formalize a checklist of failure types we now simulate during every feature release. The payoff is catching issues before they matter, which is exactly where frontend resilience starts.</p>
    <h3>Tools and techniques for frontend chaos engineering</h3>
    <p class="lead">Chaos engineering isn’t just for the backend. In modern frontend applications, where SPAs rely heavily on APIs, dynamic state, and third-party scripts, introducing controlled failures can uncover UI brittleness, bad assumptions, and missing fallback logic. Here are some tools and techniques to introduce chaos safely in the frontend.</p>
    <h3>Using gremlins.js for browser-based chaos</h3>
    <p class="lead">gremlins.js is a JavaScript library designed to unleash automated user interaction “gremlins” in your application. It simulates random clicks, touches, form fills, and input changes, helping you discover UI issues like unhandled exceptions, layout breakage, or performance bottlenecks under unpredictable usage patterns. It’s especially useful for stress testing component boundaries and identifying client-side errors during rapid input or navigation.</p>
    <h3>Simulating network failures</h3>
    <p class="lead">Using Chrome DevTools or plugins like Chrome Throttle allows you to simulate slow, flaky, or dropped network connections. You can set specific latency, throughput, or even cause complete disconnection to observe how your frontend handles loading states, retries, and timeouts. This helps validate that your app degrades gracefully under poor connectivity and provides helpful feedback to the user.</p>
    <h3>API mocking and fault injection with Mock Service Worker</h3>
    <p class="lead">Mock Service Worker (MSW) intercepts requests at the network layer in the browser using service workers, allowing you to simulate API responses and failures (timeouts, 500 errors, malformed JSON, etc.). This is powerful for chaos testing because it mimics real API interactions without needing to modify backend behavior. You can use it to test how components behave under backend outages, authorization failures, or unexpected data formats.</p>
    <h3>Feature toggles and controlled rollouts</h3>
    <p class="lead">Feature flag tools like LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or even simple in-house toggles can be used to enable chaos experiments for specific user cohorts or internal testers. This controlled exposure ensures that chaotic behavior (e.g., random UI glitches or intentional error responses) only affects a safe subset of users, enabling gradual rollouts and easy rollback if issues escalate.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="lead">This article covered how frontend chaos engineering helps catch UI and UX issues before users experience them. We learned key failure scenarios, introduced tools like gremlins.js, Mock Service Worker, and DevTools for simulating chaos, and emphasized safe practices like using feature flags, error boundaries, and controlled environments.</p>

    title: "Gaming Your Way to Sharper AI Prompts",
    content: `
    <p class="lead">A common sentiment that AI evangelists have expressed to me is their eagerness to outsource their day-to-day communications to it. I am not about to state that this is always a mistake. Certain missives are so rote and return so little for the invested effort that it’s hard to justify composing them from scratch. We’ve all sunk time into sending formulaic emails, which could have been better spent doing almost anything else.</p>
    <p class="lead">But here’s the catch: if you want AI to do its best work, you have to stay sharp yourself. These tools are only as strong as the thinking and language you bring to them.</p>
    <p class="lead">What I suspect yields the best long-term utility is to do some portion of your language composition completely unassisted. I don’t advance this out of some metaphysical concern for preserving the human soul (though it can double as that in a pinch), but as an appeal to the practical pursuit of conjuring the best AI output possible.</p>
    <p class="lead">Just as Formula 1 drivers physically condition to better handle their finely tuned machines, practicing language skills without AI augmentation hones your ability to wield AI deftly. In this article, I offer three activities — really, two warm-ups and a high-intensity workout — that help extend what you can elicit from AI and cultivate your self-expression.</p>
    <h3>On the Write Track</h3>
    <p class="lead">To start, do some writing without AI. Most of the time, our thoughts crest and subside in unpredictable waves. This rhythm can surface profound realizations, but inconsistently so. Focused, linear thinking counterbalances the mind’s tendency to spontaneity with structure. By directing attention to one thought and playing it forward from there, you can pull at one of the innumerable threads lying all around us.</p>
    <p class="lead">Writing is the documentation of this cognitive exercise — it’s like taking photographs as you follow your thoughts. The same sequential progression of reasoning at the heart of good writing is what organizes your instructions to the AI. As much as AI hype-chasers glorify what I just described as “prompt engineering”, it’s actually good, old-fashioned articulateness.</p>
    <h3>A Penny for Thoughts Is a Sound Investment</h3>
    <p class="lead">Once you’ve checked that box, start talking to people about things they understand but you don’t. Learning about something by discussing it with an expert is a kind of language puzzle, because you have to figure out how to figure out what to ask. You are prodding into the unknown. Without subject matter knowledge, you don’t know what rocks to look under.</p>
    <p class="lead">But this is a conversation: you get the chance to iterate. If you hit a dead end, you change tack. When you find one breadcrumb, you’re closer to finding a loaf. Practice formulating the right diagnostic questions, and you get faster at discovering the tailored questions that unlock more arcane knowledge. Those opening questions are the trickiest, but once you get familiar with them, you will open doors you didn’t even realize were there.</p>
    <h3>Gaming the System</h3>
    <p class="lead">Now that you’ve gotten the hang of those, you’re ready to sit down and play an old-school tabletop role-playing game (RPG). It was only a matter of time until I worked this pastime of mine into one of my articles, but I can’t imagine a more fitting pretext.</p>
    <p class="lead">For those unfamiliar with the genre, a tabletop RPG is a game in which one player, usually referred to as the “game master” or similar appellation, creates and administers an imaginary game world, and the other players each have a character that they use to interact with everything in that game world.</p>
    <p class="lead">All players are free to attempt any activity they can think of, and if it is within the capacity of their characters, they usually carry out that activity. When the success of an activity is not guaranteed or there are irreconcilable conflicts between players (especially, and typically, with the game master), dice and character statistics are used to resolve the interaction.</p>
    <p class="lead">The game interface is purely verbal: the game master describes the environment, the other players articulate what they want to do, and the game master pronounces the outcome of the players’ decisions.</p>
    <h3>Role-Playing as a Skill-Building Tool</h3>
    <p class="lead">The archetypal example of a tabletop RPG is Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). However, while entries in the genre are commonly likened to board games, the comparison is inapt. Board games rely on fixed visuals like boards, cards, and pieces, whereas tabletop RPGs need little more than character sheets and conversation. If visuals are needed, players can improvise with whatever helps everyone share a clear picture of the scene.</p>
    <p class="lead">Moreover, while board game rules exhaustively prescribe the available (and unavailable) activities in the respective game, tabletop RPG rules are merely a framework for evaluating the success of player actions. Players may do anything, even what is not explicitly sanctioned by the rules — the rules just explain how to determine the result of their actions.</p>
    <p class="lead">So what does it mean for an RPG to be “old-school” then? To condense what could easily be a PhD thesis into a brief primer, the main difference between modern tabletop RPGs and “old-school” RPGs is that while the former emphasizes character statistic optimization and rolling high, the latter focuses on player ingenuity and creative utilization of resources.</p>
    <p class="lead">Whereas disarming a mechanical trap in an abandoned tomb in a modern game may simply be a matter of declaring the use of the character’s “Disarm Trap” skill (providing a numerical bonus) and rolling a high number, doing so in an old-school game would consist of describing your character’s technique for defeating the mechanism — provide enough detail, and outline a thorough procedure, and success may be assured without rolling dice.</p>
    <p class="lead">What makes a stellar tabletop RPG player is a synthesis of the linguistic tools developed by the aforementioned warm-up routines. You start by “interrogating the fiction,” being curious enough not to take the scene at face value. Then you ask for more information about what’s around your character. You might learn even more by experimenting with the objects in your environment. Make no assumptions about what you think you know. That plain-looking bowl on the table could have magical properties.</p>
    <p class="lead">Then, you engineer a path to your goals based on your observations. You are equipped to go further than merely stating the desired end goal — which can get your character killed when the stakes get moderately high — by expressing a procedural solution. If you outline a set of steps, including interventions for possible contingencies that can arise from the present game scenario, which would succeed without a doubt, then how could you fail?</p>
    <h3>Applying RPG Thinking to AI Prompts</h3>
    <p class="lead">You can employ the old-school RPG problem-solving technique with minimal modification when crafting large language model (LLM) prompts.</p>
    <p class="lead">In both exercises, the surest route to success requires conceiving your goal in the minutest detail, establishing relevant roles (what do you think “role prompting” is?), listing all the steps to be taken, providing examples, and defining exigent circumstances and your prescribed reaction to them.</p>
    <p class="lead">It should come as no surprise that technology pioneers like Steve Wozniak and Peter Norvig were avid D&D players — their respective corpus of work was largely before generative AI. Still, their accomplishments reflect mastery of the skills that D&D demands.</p>
    <p class="lead">The order of the above exercises is deliberate. I sequenced them in order of fewest to most required players and lowest to highest difficulty of execution. There are fewer adept conversationalists than articulate writers, and even fewer stellar RPG players than engaging conversationalists. Each step builds the mental agility needed to frame better AI prompts and get more meaningful results.</p>
    <p class="lead">With that in mind, especially if these are new to you, I encourage you to progress through these exercises in order. Not only can you practice each one without an internet connection to a billion-parameter model, but (even better) they’re fun.</p>
    <p class="lead">In the age of AI, sharpening your communication skills is still the most powerful way to make the machines work for you.</p>

      "Supermicro’s redemption play: Can new leadership save the AI server specialist?",
    content: `
    <p class="lead">After months of governance scandals that saw its auditor resign and major clients flee to competitors, Supermicro is betting everything on a redemption play centred around new leadership appointments and cutting-edge technology. The AI server specialist has installed a new CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer and launched an ambitious product line – the 4-socket X14 servers with Intel Xeon 6 processors on board.</p>    
    <p class="lead">But can fresh faces in the C-suite and technical innovation overcome the trust deficit that has cost the company billions in lost contracts and sent its stock plummeting by more than 60% from its March highs?</p>
    <p class="lead">The redemption effort comes after Supermicro endured its worst crisis since 2018, when a storm of governance failures, regulatory scrutiny, and customer defections threatened to derail the company’s dominance in AI servers. To understand the scale of the challenge facing the new leadership team, it’s crucial to examine just how deep the problems run.</p>
    <h3>The scale of Supermicro’s governance crisis</h3>
    <p class="lead">Supermicro has faced similar crises before – its shares were briefly delisted from NASDAQ in 2018 due to financial filing delays. The current crisis began when the company delayed filing its annual report for the fiscal year ending 30 June 2024 for almost 50 days, following allegations by Hindenburg Research of accounting irregularities.</p>
    <p class="lead">The short-selling firm accused Supermicro of manipulating accounting data and conducting secret, related-party transactions. The situation deteriorated further when Ernst & Young (EY), Supermicro’s independent auditor, announced it was leaving its position on 30 October 2024.</p>
    <p class="lead">In its resignation letter, EY questioned the firm’s governance and internal financial reporting controls, stating it was “no longer able to accept [the] management’s and Audit Committee’s statements.”</p>
    <p class="lead">Perhaps most damaging to Supermicro’s immediate prospects, Elon Musk’s AI then-startup xAI redirected its AI server orders to Dell, a move that reportedly cost Supermicro billions in potential revenue, and became the exemplar of a broader industry concern about Supermicro’s reliability as a strategic partner.</p>
    <p class="lead">In layperson’s terms, enterprises are concerned about investing in hardware, on which their businesses rely, from a company that is not transparent about its financial position, and so may not be in a position to fulfil its contractual obligations.</p>
    <h3>Enterprise server contracts: The long-term challenge</h3>
    <p class="lead">Understanding the typical duration of enterprise server contracts provides some insight into Supermicro’s potential recovery from its governance crisis. Based on industry norms, enterprise agreements typically span three years: in general, Microsoft Enterprise Agreements’ length represent a benchmark for the industry. Data shows companies with over $250K median annual contract value book nearly 25% of their contracts to last three years or longer.</p>
    <p class="lead">For Supermicro this creates challenges and opportunities for overcoming its governance crisis. While the company may have lost immediate deals due to trust concerns, the three-year cycle means that many enterprise customers will reassess their server partnerships between 2025 and 2028, providing a defined window for Supermicro’s redemption efforts.</p>
    <p class="lead">Enter the company’s new product line. “The modern 4-socket servers solve multiple pain points that have intensified with GenAI and memory-intensive analytics,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, to Network World.</p>
    <p class="lead">The technical merits of Supermicro’s new offerings could help accelerate the recovery timeline if its governance concerns are addressed adequately, too.</p>
    <h3>Competitive landscape and market share dynamics</h3>
    <p class="lead">The server market landscape has shifted during Supermicro’s troubles. Dell controlled 58% of the global server market at the beginning of 2024, while Supermicro held just 6%. However, in the high-performance AI server segment, Supermicro had begun to carve out a dominant position.</p>
    <p class="lead">Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh predicted [paywall] last year that competitive pressure would reduce Supermicro’s share of the AI server market from roughly 80%-100% in 2022-2023 to about 40%-50% in 2024, a decline that reflected governance concerns and the entry of traditional players like Dell and HPE into the AI server space.</p>
    <p class="lead">Market dynamics suggest Supermicro’s recovery timeline will be influenced by how quickly it can differentiate its offerings. Neil Shah, vice president at Counterpoint Research, noted, “Being the first to market with Intel Xeon 6-based 4-socket X14 servers gives Supermicro a fillip in this data centre build-out gold rush.”</p>
    <h3>Technical innovation as a recovery catalyst</h3>
    <p class="lead">The X14 platform announcement represents Supermicro’s hope that technical superiority can accelerate its recovery. The new X14 servers support up to 344 CPU cores, 16TB of memory, and 6 double-width GPUs, target compute-heavy enterprise workloads, and offer in-memory databases – features that target high-performance applications.</p>
    <p class="lead">Crucially, the X14 promises a 50% performance boost, with support for CXL 2.0, PCIe 5.0 slots, and a design optimised for redundancy and resilience. The technical advantages could help compress the Supermicro recovery timeline by providing persuasive reasons for enterprises to consider the company despite any remaining governance concerns.</p>
    <p class="lead">Industry analyst Manish Rawat from TechInsights suggested that “by aligning closely with Intel’s latest Xeon roadmap, Supermicro is well-positioned to benefit from a 2025 enterprise shift toward more database-integrated GenAI deployments.”</p>
    <h3>The path to recovery: Concrete steps and timeline</h3>
    <p class="lead">Supermicro has taken several concrete steps to address its governance issues, which could shorten the recovery timeline. The company formed an independent, special committee that found no evidence of fraud or intentional misconduct, and appointed a new CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and General Counsel.</p>
    <p class="lead">On November 19, 2024, Supermicro filed a compliance plan and hired BDO USA as its new independent auditor to address NASDAQ’s concerns. The market responded positively, with Supermicro stock gaining 40% that week.</p>
    <p class="lead">However, the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the company’s accounting practices in September 2024, apparently as a result of a former employee whistleblower action. The ongoing legal scrutiny could extend the recovery timeline depending on the investigation’s speed and outcome.</p>
    <h3>Market analyst projections</h3>
    <p class="lead">Several analysts have provided insights into the potential Supermicro recovery timeline, with the consensus among industry observers suggesting that a meaningful recovery could begin in 12-18 months. However, full trust restoration may take two to three years, aligning with typical enterprise contract cycles.</p>
    <h3>The broader industry context</h3>
    <p class="lead">The AI server market’s explosive growth provides a favourable backdrop for Supermicro’s recovery efforts. According to Data Monsters News, combined revenue from infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud grew to $195 billion in 2024, an annual growth rate of over 20%.</p>
    <p class="lead">Such growth creates opportunities for multiple players to succeed simultaneously. As noted in The Motley Fool’s analysis in 2024, “Dell, HPE, and others will likely gain ground against Supermicro, but there could be plenty of room for all of these companies to flourish without trampling each other.”</p>
    <h3>Industry analysis: Key factors being watched</h3>
    <p class="lead">Industry analysts have identified several factors to monitor to assess Supermicro’s redemption efforts:</p>
    <p class="lead">Governance reforms: The appointment of new leadership and independent audit findings provide what Manish Rawat from TechInsights called “a strategic reinforcement for Supermicro.” However, analysts emphasise that sustained execution will be critical for rebuilding enterprise confidence.</p>
    <p class="lead">Technical innovation: The 4-socket X14 servers represent what Neil Shah from Counterpoint Research described as giving “Supermicro a fillip in this data centre build-out gold rush.” The question remains whether the company can maintain its innovation pace against well-funded competitors.</p>
    <p class="lead">Market positioning: As Devroop Dhar from Primus Partner noted, “Launching a 4-socket Xeon 6 platform and packaging it in their modular ‘building block’ strategy shows Supermicro is focusing on staying ahead in enterprise and AI data centre compute.”</p>
    <h3>What analysts are saying about recovery prospects</h3>
    <p class="lead">Several industry observers have shared their perspectives on Supermicro’s path forward, though they acknowledge significant uncertainty remains.</p>
    <p class="lead">Short-term outlook: Market analysts have noted that continued governance improvements and technical product launches could help stabilise the company. However, the ongoing DOJ investigation adds an element of unpredictability in the near-term.</p>
    <p class="lead">Medium-term considerations: The typical three-year duration means many customers will reassess their server partnerships between 2025 and 2028, providing what analysts describe as a window of opportunity for Supermicro’s redemption efforts.</p>
    <p class="lead">Long-term perspective: Complete trust restoration in B2B markets typically requires demonstration of sustained performance over multiple contract cycles.</p>
    <p class="lead">The company’s ultimate success, according to industry observers, will depend on executing consistently in a market where competitors continue advancing their capabilities.</p>

    title: "Oracle to launch cloud operations in Indonesia through DayOne deal",
    content: `
    <p class="lead">Oracle is set to expand into Indonesia by leasing data centre space from DayOne Data Centres, according to people with knowledge of the deal. The move would mark Oracle’s first cloud services operation in the country and deepen its relationship with a regional player that counts ByteDance as its biggest client.</p>
    <p class="lead">DayOne, based in Singapore, is a spin-off from Chinese data centre company GDS Holdings. It serves international customers, with TikTok owner ByteDance as its top customer and Oracle close behind.</p>
    <p class="lead">Oracle will take over data centre plots at Nongsa Digital Park, located on Indonesia’s Batam island. The park is already a tech hub, drawing operators due to its free-trade zone status and proximity to Singapore and Malaysia. The sites Oracle plans to lease could support at least 120 megawatts of capacity, according to sources close to the deal. That scale suggests a major investment – facilities of such a size typically require over US$1 billion to build, depending on location, equipment, and intended use.</p>
    <p class="lead">Oracle will be the only tenant at the DayOne sites, sources said. Neither company responded to requests for comment.</p>
    <p class="lead">Oracle already runs two cloud data centres in Singapore and is building another in Malaysia. Earlier this year, it also set up an AI Centre of Excellence in Singapore and outlined a plan to train 10,000 people in digital skills by 2027.</p>
    <p class="lead">DayOne’s connection to China-based GDS Holdings remains active, with GDS keeping a stake in the spinoff. ByteDance continues to dominate as DayOne’s largest customer, according to research firm SemiAnalysis.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Batam deal comes as US tech firms ramp up their presence in Asia to support growing AI infrastructure needs. Meta and Google have focused investments in countries with more developed networks like Singapore and Malaysia. Salesforce recently announced a US$1 billion commitment to Singapore, and Oracle pledged US$6.5 billion for cloud infrastructure in Malaysia last year.</p>
    <p class="lead">The move also ties into Oracle’s broader work with OpenAI. The AI firm is leasing large amounts of computing power from Oracle under the Stargate initiative – a US$500 billion project to build AI-focused data centres both in the US and abroad, backed by partners including Oracle and SoftBank.</p>
    <p class="lead">Consulting firm Bain expects the global market for AI products and services to approach US$1 trillion by 2027. That outlook is pushing more tech companies to scale their infrastructure, especially in Asia, where cloud demand and AI adoption are rising fast.</p>

    title: "Top 10 AI-Powered Cloud Security Tools for 2025",
    content: `
    <p class="lead">As cloud usage continues to rise sharply, so do the ransomware attacks and cybersecurity incidents. The security teams are scrambling to stay ahead of the attackers and manage security risks more effectively with AI cloud security solutions. </p>
    <p class="lead">These cloud security tools utilise artificial intelligence to help detect anomalies, automate responses, and provide predictive insights, surpassing traditional "rule-based" practices. These tools are not just reactive; they learn from patterns and adapt as tools and hackers change, helping organisations to stay ahead of threats.</p>
    <p class="lead">-In this article, we will review the top 10 AI-powered cloud security tools that will matter most in the coming year, based on thorough research from industry sources.</p>
    <h3>What are Cloud Security Tools?</h3>
    <p class="lead">Cloud security tools are purpose-built software solutions that protect data, applications, and infrastructure located in a cloud environment (public, private, or hybrid). These tools help organisations manage risks, identify threats, demonstrate compliance with regulations, and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their resources in the cloud. </p>
    <p class="lead">The cloud security tools typically offer a variety of capabilities, including: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): Scans cloud accounts for misconfiguration and compliance risks. </li>
      <li>Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP): Protects virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions that operate in the cloud. </li>
      <li>Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM): Manages identities and access permissions across cloud services to mitigate the over-expenditure of privileges. </li>
      <li>Detection and Response: Monitors cloud activities for anomalous behaviour and security incidents.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why AI Cloud Security Matters Now</h3>
    <p class="lead">The speed and dynamic nature of cloud environments continuously challenge traditional security methods. AI cloud security solutions are uniquely suited to address these challenges by providing benefits like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved Threat Detection: AI can analyse millions of data points in real-time to identify the subtle signs of evolving threats that rule-based systems often miss.</li>
      <li>Reduced Alert Fatigue: To combat alert fatigue, machine learning can prioritise alerts by filtering out false positives and identifying what constitutes a genuine risk.</li>
      <li>Automated Response: AI can automate everyday security tasks and actions based on what is detected, significantly reducing reaction times.</li>
      <li>Scalability: As cloud environments continue to grow, the use of AI-powered security tools can scale to match the increasing security needs of monitoring expanding and heterogeneous resources.</li>
      <li>Versatile Risk Management: AI can actively identify potential vulnerabilities and incoming threats before they are hijacked, making security more proactive than reactive.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The 10 Best AI-Powered Cloud Security Tools</h3>
    <p class="lead">We ranked and rated these cloud security platforms based on several factors, including innovation, peer-reviewed customer experience, market presence, and AI capabilities. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Wiz</li>
        <p class="lead">WIZ has quickly emerged as a leader in providing cloud security and is recognised for its agentless approach to providing continuity across complex multi-cloud environments. Rather than focusing on the risk of a single cloud app, Wiz focuses on the interconnectedness of cloud assets across multi-cloud environments, addressing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that pose a risk of breaches for industries that need to do so. </p>
        <p class="lead">It provides visibility across a multi-cloud environment without the need for agents, which substantially simplifies deployment and management. It excels at analyzing context, identifying high-severity risks, limiting false positives, and focusing security initiatives on the most significant issues. </p>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Continuously scans cloud controls looking for cloud misconfigurations or compliance violations. </li>

    title: "Evolving Android’s early-access programs: Introducing the Canary channel",
    content: `
    <p class="lead">To better support you and provide earlier, more consistent access to in-development features, we are announcing a significant evolution in our pre-release program. Moving forward, the Android platform will have a Canary release channel, which will replace the previous developer preview program. This Canary release channel will function alongside the existing beta program.</p>
    <p class="lead">This change is designed to provide a more streamlined and continuous opportunity for you to try out new platform capabilities and provide feedback throughout the entire year, not just in the early months of a new release cycle.</p>
    <h3>Limitations of the previous developer preview model</h3>
    <p class="lead">The Developer Preview program has been a critical part of our release cycle, but its structure had inherent limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developer Previews were not tied to a release channel, and had to be manually flashed to devices every time the cycle would restart.</li>
      <li>Because previews were tied to the next designated Android release, they were only available during the earliest part of the cycle. Once a platform version reached the Beta stage, the preview track would end, creating a gap where features that were promising but not yet ready for Beta had no official channel for feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>A continuous flow of features with the Canary channel</h3>
    <p class="lead">The new Android platform Canary channel addresses these challenges directly. By flashing your supported Pixel device to the Canary release channel, you can now receive a continuous, rolling stream of the latest platform builds via over-the-air (OTA) updates.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can try out and provide input on new features and planned behavior changes in their earliest stages. These changes may not always make it into a stable Android release.</li>
      <li>The Canary release channel will run in parallel with the beta program. The beta program remains the way for you to try a more polished set of likely soon-to-be-released features.</li>
      <li>You can use the Canary builds with your CI to see if any of our in-development features cause unexpected problems with your app, maximizing the time we have to address your concerns.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Who should use the Canary channel?</h3>
    <p class="lead">The Canary channel is intended for developers that want to explore and test with the earliest pre-release Android APIs and potential behavior changes. Builds from the Canary channel will have passed our automated tests as well as experienced a short test cycle with internal users. You should expect bugs and breaking changes. These bleeding-edge builds will not be the best choice for someone to use as their primary or only device.</p>
    <p class="lead">The existing beta channel will remain the primary way for you to make sure that your apps are both compatible with and take advantage of upcoming platform features.</p>
    <h3>Getting started and providing feedback</h3>
    <p class="lead">You can use the Android Flash Tool to get the most recent Canary build onto your supported Pixel device. Once flashed, you should expect OTA updates for the latest Canary builds as they become available. To exit the channel, flash a Beta or Public build to your device. This will require a data partition wipe.</p>
    <p class="lead">Canary releases will be available on the Android Emulator through the Device Manager in Android Studio (currently, just in the Android Studio Canary channel), and Canary SDKs will be available for you to develop against through the SDK Manager.</p>
    <p class="lead">Since most behavior changes require targeting a release, you can target Canary releases the way you can target any other platform SDK version, or use the Compatibility Framework with supported features to enable behavior changes in your apps.</p>
    <p class="lead">Feedback is a critical component of this new program, so please file feature feedback and bug reports on your Canary experience through the Google Issue Tracker.</p>
    <p class="lead">By transitioning to a true Canary channel, we aim to create a more transparent, collaborative, and efficient development process, giving you the seamless access you need to prepare for the future of Android.</p>

    title: "How Wearable Devices Are Transforming Preventative Healthcare",
    content: `
    <p class="lead">In recent times, we have seen the birth of wearable devices that have revolutionized the healthcare system. These have evolved from being mere sports-oriented devices to including smartwatches that check heart rates and pedometers. One of the ways they make a difference is that they encourage preventative healthcare. Meaning that all parties (individuals and practitioners) play an active role in keeping diseases at bay.</p>
    <p class="lead">Wearable devices collect and deliver data instantaneously, manage important indicators of health conditions, and, when combined with <PlainCode>healthcare app development</PlainCode>, offer a full range of options for monitoring patients’ health and preventing illnesses. This blog will shed light on the role of wearable devices in the field of preventative healthcare and the prospects of their development in clinical practice.</p>
    <h3>The Growth of the Use of Wearable Devices in the Medical Field</h3>
    <p class="lead">The past decade has seen a remarkable expansion in the already significant market of wearable technology, spurred by the rising appetite for self-monitored health. Reports by Statista suggest that by 2027, the worldwide market for wearable health devices is expected to surpass $60 billion in market growth. The need for wearables arose to satisfy the demand for continuous health monitoring, regardless of whether the patient is within or outside the medical care setting.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Apple Watch, Fitbit, and similar fitness trackers were originally designed as activity monitors. But over the years, they now incorporate features where they can track heart rate, sleep quality, blood oxygen levels, and other vital signs. These metrics, collected in real time, contribute to understanding an individual's health and enable early detection of potential problems.</p>
    <h3>Wearables and Preventative Healthcare</h3>
    <p class="lead">Preventative healthcare focuses on preventing illnesses rather than treating them once they've already manifested. This area has greatly benefited from the rise of wearable devices because they provide crucial information aimed at preventing time-consuming and expensive conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and even some mental health issues. Here's how wearables are changing the healthcare system:</p>
    <h3>Continuous Monitoring for Early Recognition</h3>
    <p class="lead">The most promising feature of wearable devices is their ability to provide round-the-clock surveillance of specific health parameters. For example, a smartwatch can track heart rate, physical activity, and sleep patterns. Some sophisticated wearable gadgets can even monitor blood glucose levels or detect abnormal heart rhythms.</p>
    <p class="lead">Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Wearable devices embedded with ECG (electrocardiogram) technology enable users to monitor heart rate and detect abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation, which significantly increases the risk of stroke. Early detection through these devices allows individuals to seek medical attention before symptoms worsen, potentially saving lives.</p>
    <p class="lead">These features, when integrated with <PlainCode>healthcare app development</PlainCode>, enable users or their caregivers to receive real-time alerts, prompting early clinical action.</p>
    <h3>Encouraging Healthier Choices</h3>
    <p class="lead">Another way in which wearables contribute to <b>preventative healthcare</b> is by encouraging healthier lifestyle habits. Many devices feature components that promote physical activity, proper sleep, and better diet management. For example, fitness bands track user inactivity and remind them to move, while sleep bands monitor sleep patterns and suggest ways to improve rest.</p>
    <p class="lead">These gadgets reduce the uncertainty surrounding behavioral changes by providing daily updates that guide users on decisions related to their health. When paired with applications, they facilitate interactions that empower users to set objectives, monitor progress, and receive recommendations for improving their health.</p>
    <p class="lead">Based on this functionality, <PlainCode>healthcare app development</PlainCode> is actively engaged in providing platforms where users can effectively manage their own health data. For instance, instead of tracking a single wearable device, healthcare apps can aggregate data from multiple devices and create powerful dashboards for patients. This integration encourages users to take a more active role in their overall well-being.</p>
    <h3>Chronic Disease Management</h3>
    <p class="lead">Wearable devices have been particularly useful in managing chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Devices like continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and smart blood pressure monitors allow individuals to manage their conditions more effectively and prevent potential complications.</p>
    <p class="lead">For example, a CGM tracks blood glucose levels in diabetic patients throughout the day, showing how diet, medication, and physical activity affect blood sugar. With real-time data available via a mobile app, patients can make immediate adjustments to avoid dangerous spikes or drops in glucose levels.</p>
    <p class="lead">Additionally, patients can send their wearable data directly to healthcare providers via applications, allowing doctors to monitor patient progress remotely and adjust treatment plans as needed. This reduces the need for frequent clinic visits.</p>
    <h3>Integration of Wearables with healthcare app development</h3>
    <p class="lead">The real power of wearable devices is realized when they are integrated with <PlainCode>healthcare app development</PlainCode>. By syncing data from wearables to mobile or cloud-based applications, healthcare providers and patients gain access to comprehensive health records in real time.</p>
    <h3>Real-time Data Analysis</h3>
    <p class="lead">Apps linked to wearable devices can analyze large amounts of health data in real time. They apply algorithms to detect patterns and flag potential risks. For example, if a fitness tracker detects a spike in heart rate while a user is at rest, the app could alert them to seek medical advice. Healthcare apps also enable users to set and track health goals and provide personalized recommendations based on health data.</p>
    <h3>Personalized Healthcare Solutions</h3>
    <p class="lead">With advancements in <PlainCode>healthcare app development</PlainCode>, wearable data can be customized to suit individual needs. Whether it's diet plans, workout regimens, or stress-relieving activities, healthcare apps offer tailored advice. This personalized approach can make a significant difference in promoting better health and preventing illnesses.</p>
    <p class="lead">Healthcare apps also offer a more effective way to manage conditions, offering features that suggest stress-relieving exercises during periods of discomfort or recommend follow-up care after completing a treatment plan.</p>
    <h3>Remote Patient Monitoring</h3>
    <p class="lead">Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is another critical aspect of healthcare app development. Wearable devices connected to healthcare apps allow doctors to monitor patients’ health remotely without the need for in-person visits. This is particularly valuable for elderly patients or those with chronic conditions.</p>
    <p class="lead">RPM enables healthcare providers to intervene early if the data indicates potential health issues, offering a more proactive approach to patient care. This evolution in healthcare ensures that patients receive timely treatment without having to visit healthcare facilities regularly.</p>
    <h3>The Future of Wearable Devices in Preventative Healthcare</h3>
    <p class="lead">The future of wearable devices in healthcare is bright. These devices will continue to evolve, offering even more advanced features, such as monitoring respiratory conditions, detecting neurological disease precursors, and diagnosing illnesses using continuous biometric tracking.</p>
    <p class="lead">In addition, trends in <PlainCode>healthcare app development</PlainCode> will focus on enhancing integration with wearable devices, further improving patient care by creating seamless connections between various virtual health systems.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="lead">Wearable devices, coupled with <PlainCode>healthcare app development</PlainCode>, are transforming the way we approach healthcare. These devices provide real-time health data, empowering users to take control of their health. By promoting healthier habits, enabling early detection of illnesses, and supporting chronic disease management, wearables are paving the way for a more data-driven and patient-centered healthcare system.</p>
    <p class="lead">The healthcare of tomorrow will be more predictive, proactive, and personalized. Wearable technology will play a critical role in this transformation, making preventative healthcare more accessible and effective for everyone.</p>
