also for the color brand use this..
This are the two colours which can also go with orange colours for the buttons and then background colour oxblood or navy blue..... or rather you can mix them, dont make the background of the official website to be white backgound, rather mix it in some sections dont use orange for background for buttons use gradient background, make it proffesional use the refeerence image i have attached for more clearification for the colors mixture.
for the backend, use neon sinec there is javascript language.. i have a neon account to use
